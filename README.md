## Plugins

### building a plugin/theme
To build a plugin you need to create a json file with the following structure:
```json
 {
  "name": "Aura Theme",
  "description": "A beautiful and elegant theme with a soothing color scheme.",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "theme", 
  "file": "path/to/theme/file.css",
  "author": "John Doe"
}

 ```

`"name"`: The name of the plugin or theme<br>
`"description"`: A brief description of its features or visual style<br>
`"version"`: The version number of the plugin or theme<br>
`"type"`: Specify whether it is a "plugin" or a "theme"<br>
`"file"`: The path to the CSS/JS file that contains the styling or functionality of the plugin or theme.<br>
`"author"`: The name of the author or creator of the plugin or theme<br>


### testing a plugin/theme
