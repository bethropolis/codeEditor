## Plugins
### building a plugin/theme
To build a plugin file you need to create a json file with the following structure:
```json
 {
  "name": "Aura Theme",
  "description": "A beautiful and elegant theme with a soothing color scheme.",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "image": "path/to/logo.png",
  "type": "theme", // Either "theme" or "plugin"
  "file": "path/to/theme/file.css", // For type: "plugin", provide the path to the JS file
  "author": "John Doe"
}

 ```
### testing a plugin/theme
To try out your plugin or theme, open the Haze Editor, go to the Plugins section, and click the "Load plugin" button.
